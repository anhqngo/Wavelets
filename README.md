# Introduction to Wavelets and Its Applications

Since the start of the 20th century, we have seen rapid development in the theory and applications of wavelets. As a mathematical tool, wavelets can be used to extract information from different kinds of data such as audio signals and images.

This paper will explore what wavelets are, introduce readers to the first orthonormal wavelet basis: the Haar system, approximate functions using Haar wavelets, and discuss the applications of wavelets in image compression.
